This project will be about formating texts in a file. 
Most code is from the book example 15.3.

The thing I need to modify is in the line.c file. Store the current line in a 
linked list. Each node in the list will store a single word. The line array
will be replaced by a variable that points to the node containing the first
word. This variable will store a null pointer whenever the line is empty.
