Q: When I opened the txt file in a hex editor, I cannot see the EOF indicator, why?

Well, EOF is an integer error code returned by a function, like fread, read.
EOF is not stored in the file. EOF (usually defined as -1) is returned by OS 
when there's no more data to read or an input error occurred. 
So once you reach the end of file, you must hit EOF.

Q: When I read a text file and there are numbers in it, what will happen if
I simply read it in "r" mode?


Q: If file pointer is null, do I have to use fclose()? 

Not only it is not necessary to use fclose() when f is NULL, but you should 
actually not invoke fclose() when f is NULL.

If f is NULL, then the file was never opened to begin with, so it does not need 
any closing. Even if the file somehow needed closing, the solution could not 
possibly involve passing NULL to fclose(), because a NULL parameter carries 
absolutely no information that fclose() can use to figure out which file to close.
