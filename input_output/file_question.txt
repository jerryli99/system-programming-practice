Q: When I opened the txt file in a hex editor, I cannot see the EOF indicator, why?

Well, EOF is an integer error code returned by a function, like fread, read.
EOF is not stored in the file. EOF (usually defined as -1) is returned by OS 
when there's no more data to read or an input error occurred. 
So once you reach the end of file, you must hit EOF.

Q: When I read a text file and there are numbers in it, what will happen if
I simply read it in "r" mode?
